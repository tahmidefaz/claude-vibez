 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> make a plan for a flappy bird game using html/css/javascript

⏺ I'll create a plan for building a Flappy Bird game using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Let me break this down into manageable tasks.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create basic HTML structure with canvas element              
     ☐ Set up CSS styling for game container and UI elements
     ☐ Initialize JavaScript game engine with canvas context
     ☐ Create bird object with physics (position, velocity, gravity)
     ☐ Implement bird jump mechanics on spacebar/click
     ☐ Create pipe objects with random heights
     ☐ Add pipe movement and spawning system
     ☐ Implement collision detection between bird and pipes/ground
     ☐ Add scoring system when bird passes through pipes
     ☐ Create game states (start screen, playing, game over)
     ☐ Add restart functionality
     ☐ Implement background and visual polish

⏺ Flappy Bird Game Plan

  Here's a structured plan to build a complete Flappy Bird game:

  Core Structure

  1. HTML Foundation - Canvas element for game rendering
  2. CSS Styling - Game container and UI elements
  3. JavaScript Engine - Canvas context and game loop

  Game Mechanics

  4. Bird Physics - Position, velocity, and gravity system
  5. Jump Controls - Spacebar/click input handling
  6. Pipe System - Dynamic pipe generation with random heights
  7. Movement Logic - Continuous pipe scrolling

  Game Logic

  8. Collision Detection - Bird vs pipes and ground boundaries
  9. Scoring System - Points for successfully passing pipes
  10. Game States - Start screen, active gameplay, and game over
  11. Restart Functionality - Reset game after game over

  Polish

  12. Visual Enhancement - Background graphics and animations

  This plan creates a fully functional Flappy Bird clone with proper game states, physics, and user interaction. Each task builds upon the previous ones to create a complete gaming experience.

> please implement.

⏺ I'll implement the Flappy Bird game following the plan. Let me start by creating the basic HTML structure.

⏺ The Flappy Bird game is now fully implemented! Here's what I've created:

  Files:
  - index.html - Game structure with canvas and UI elements
  - style.css - Styling for the game container, screens, and score display
  - script.js - Complete game logic with physics, collision detection, and game states

  Features implemented:
  - Bird with realistic physics (gravity and jump mechanics)
  - Randomly generated pipes with gaps
  - Collision detection between bird, pipes, and ground
  - Scoring system that increments when passing through pipes
  - Game states: start screen, active gameplay, and game over
  - Restart functionality
  - Responsive controls (spacebar or mouse click)
  - Visual polish with gradient backgrounds and styled UI

  To play the game, open index.html in a web browser. Press spacebar or click to make the bird jump and navigate through the pipes. The game tracks your score and allows you to restart after game over.

> can you make it so that it tracks the highscore for the session? Like, if I refresh, the highscore will reset to 0, otherwise it'll show the highscore

⏺ I'll add session-based high score tracking to the game. Let me update the code to include this feature.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Add high score tracking for current session

⏺ Perfect! I've added session-based high score tracking to the Flappy Bird game. Here's what I implemented:

  New Features:
  - High score tracking that persists during the current session
  - High score display on the game screen (below current score)
  - High score shown on start screen and game over screen
  - High score updates in real-time when a new record is set

  Changes made:
  1. HTML - Added high score elements to all screens
  2. CSS - Styled the high score display below the current score
  3. JavaScript - Added high score logic that:
    - Tracks the highest score achieved during the session
    - Updates the high score when current score exceeds it
    - Displays high score on all relevant screens
    - Resets to 0 when the page is refreshed

  The high score will now track your best score for the current browser session. When you refresh the page, it resets to 0, but otherwise it will remember your highest score as you play multiple games.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Reduce game speed and bird physics for better playability

⏺ Done! I've slowed down the game to make it more playable:

  Changes made:
  - Gravity: Reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 (bird falls slower)
  - Jump Force: Reduced from -12 to -8 (bird jumps less aggressively)
  - Pipe Speed: Reduced from 3 to 2 (pipes move slower)
  - Pipe Spawn Rate: Increased from every 90 frames to every 120 frames (more time between pipes)

  The game should now feel much more manageable and give you better control over the bird's movement.

  ⎿  ☒ Further reduce game speed for even slower gameplay

⏺ The game is now even slower:

  Additional changes:
  - Gravity: Reduced from 0.4 to 0.25 (bird falls much slower)
  - Jump Force: Reduced from -8 to -6 (gentler jumps)
  - Pipe Speed: Reduced from 2 to 1.5 (pipes move slower)
  - Pipe Spawn Rate: Increased from every 120 frames to every 150 frames (even more time between pipes)

  The game should now be much more relaxed and easier to control.

> Can you make progressive difficulty mode? When I start playing, it will be much much easier then current settings until I hit a score of 10. After that, the difficulty will start slowly increasing every 
  10 points.

⏺ I'll implement a progressive difficulty system that starts easier and gradually increases as your score goes up.

  ⎿  ☒ Implement progressive difficulty system based on score

⏺ Perfect! I've implemented a progressive difficulty system. Here's how it works:

  Starting Difficulty (Score 0-9):
  - Very easy settings to help you learn
  - Gravity: 0.15 (very slow fall)
  - Jump Force: -5 (gentle jumps)
  - Pipe Speed: 1 (slow movement)
  - Pipe Gap: 180 (wide gaps)
  - Pipe Spawn: Every 200 frames (lots of time between pipes)

  Progressive Difficulty (Score 10+):
  - Every 10 points after score 10, difficulty increases
  - At score 10, 20, 30, etc., the game gets harder by:
    - Increasing gravity (bird falls faster)
    - Stronger jump force (more aggressive jumps)
    - Faster pipe movement
    - Smaller pipe gaps (minimum 120)
    - More frequent pipe spawning (minimum every 80 frames)

  How it scales:
  - Score 10-19: Slightly harder
  - Score 20-29: Moderately harder
  - Score 30+: Significantly more challenging

  The difficulty resets to easy mode every time you start a new game, so you always begin with the gentle learning curve.

   transition as you progress through the difficulty levels.

  - Handles browser autoplay restrictions gracefully

  The music will start playing when you begin a game and pause during game over. Make sure the music.mp3 file is in the same directory as your HTML file for it to work properly.

  - Game over sound (gameover.mp3) plays once when the bird dies
  - Background music stops when bird dies
  - Game over sound plays immediately after background music stops
  - No music plays during the game over screen (as requested)
  - Background music resumes only when starting a new game

  Audio Flow:
  1. Start game → Background music plays
  2. Bird dies → Background music stops + Game over sound plays once
  3. Game over screen → Silence
  4. Start new game → Background music resumes from beginning

  Make sure you have both music.mp3 and gameover.mp3 files in the same directory as your HTML file.

  - Start screen: Click anywhere to start the game
  - Game over screen: Click anywhere to restart
  - During gameplay: Click anywhere on canvas to make bird jump

  The issue was that the overlay screens (start and game over) were blocking clicks from reaching the canvas. Now all three scenarios have dedicated click handlers that work properly.
